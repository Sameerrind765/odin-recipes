     <ul>
     <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
        Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
    </li>      
    <li>
        Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.

        Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.

    <li>
        Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
